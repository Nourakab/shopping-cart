Challenge: Build a Simple Shopping Cart Application
Requirements:

Add Items to Cart:
Create a list of products (with name, price, and quantity available) that cashiers can select from and add to a cart.
When an item is added, it should be added to the cart with the correct quantity and price.

Display Cart Items:
Show a list of all items in the cart with their name, quantity, and total price for that item.
Allow cashiers to adjust the quantity of each item directly in the cart (up to the available stock).

Calculate Total:
Calculate and display the total price of all items in the cart.
Apply a 15% sales tax to the final total.

Remove Items:
Allow cashiers to remove items from the cart.
Apply Discounts:

Include an input field where cashiers can apply a percentage-based discount (e.g., 10% off).
Reflect the discounted total in the cart.

Additional Considerations:
The application should update the cart and total in real-time as items are added, removed, or adjusted.
Handle edge cases such as trying to add more items than are in stock or applying invalid discounts.
Display an error message if the cashier tries to add an invalid quantity or apply an invalid discount.

Bonus (Optional):
Implement local storage so that the cart's contents persist if the page is refreshed.
Include basic form validation to ensure that cashiers can only input valid data.
Make the UI responsive for different screen sizes.
